# Getting Started 

Start here!  This section will cover the setup of the required tools to
program for the team. Head into each folder in order (starting with 01-git) to
get started programming with FIRST Team 342.

# Git

Our team uses the version control system <a href=www.git-scm.com>Git</a> to
manage code and other related projects. Which git tools you use is up to you,
but these lessons will cover the installation and use of Git for Windows.

# Basic computer concepts

TODO Basic computer science and computer system knowledge that students are
expected to know before joining the programming team. Does not have to be
strict requirement, but beginners would be suggested to do more studying on
their own. Without these concepts, the students may not be able to make
significant contributions to the programming team because they won't be able to
work well with other programming students and will frequently need refreshers
on topics. This should also help judge a students proficiency.

Some example concepts:

1. What is a programming language

2. What are the critical components of a computer

3. Comparison of tasks that computers and robots do well vs tasks humans do
   well

4. How computer networks work

5. Basic troubleshooting

6. Basic windows configuration and useful tools

# Programming

## Java

TODO Practice java concepts that will be useful for robot java development

## Python

TODO python

# Opencv

TODO Used for object detection and other image processing. slightly advanced
concept.

# Pi/roborio/git shell linux

TODO Very basic introduction to working with the linux command line, which is
occasionally useful for working with some lower level configuration details.
