My attempt to write more focused programming lessons

# Overview

Computer science is a broad topic, and getting started with any part of it can
be overwhelming. I am going to use Python programming as a jumping off point to
get started with all the basics of computer science as a whole. This tutorial
will mostly focus on the language, but I will try to tie in outside topics for
the reader to understand where this fits in the scheme of things, and to allow
the reader to do further research.

I will be using the official python tutorial by the python development team.
The tutorial very well written on its own, but I wanted my own version to allow
more focused teaching.

# Getting Started

First read the intro in chapter 1 to get a basic understanding.
