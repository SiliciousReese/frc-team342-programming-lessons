* Getting git

	* Getting git should be pretty straight forward on any computer. Follow the directions for your operating system below. IF you're not sure what operating system you're running, ask if you can, or try them all as an alternative. There's no way to install windows git on linux or vice versa without a lot of extra work not covered here.

	*Windows
		*Installing git on windows starts with downloading the installer. Doing a search for git for windows should take you to <https://git-scm.com/download/win> where the download starts automaticly. If not, select the link 64-bit Git for Windows Setup, or 32 bit if after downloading, the file won't run.

		*Next, run the setup program.
